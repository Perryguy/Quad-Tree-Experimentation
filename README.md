# Quad Tree Experimentation
 A deep dive into the Quad Tree data structure in JavaScript with Visualisations.

## What is a QuadTree? 
A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has up to four children. It is a space-partitioning data structure, which means that it is used to divide a two-dimensional space into rectangles or squares, called "nodes". Each node in a quadtree represents a rectangular area in the two-dimensional space, and each leaf node represents a single point in that space. The advantage of using a quadtree is that it allows for efficient spatial querying, such as searching for points within a given region or checking whether a point is contained within a given region. This makes it a useful data structure for a wide range of applications, such as computer graphics, image processing, and geographical information systems.
